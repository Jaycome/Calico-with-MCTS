# Implementing Decision-Making Algorithms in Calico
This is a digital version of board game Calico. It implements Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS) in order to analyse the performance of MCTS agent and other methods.
There are two variants could be modified which are the time for MCTS agents to consider the actions that could take and the constant factor dealing with the exploration-exploitation dilemma. Besides, in this project, it includes two MCTS agents with different measures of calculating the points that possible acitons could draw, one with only considering the outcome of evaluations and the other with the points that the actions could gain.
